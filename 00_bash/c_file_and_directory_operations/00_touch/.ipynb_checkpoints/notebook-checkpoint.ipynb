      "     any file does not exist, it is created with default permissions.\n",
      "\n",
      "     By default, touch changes both modification and access times.  The -a and\n",
      "     -m flags may be used to select the access time or the modification time\n",
      "     individually.  Selecting both is equivalent to the default.  By default,\n",
      "     the timestamps are set to the current time.  The -t flag explicitly spec-\n",
      "     ifies a different time, and the -r flag specifies to set the times those\n",
      "     of the specified file.  The -A flag adjusts the values by a specified\n",
      "     amount.\n",
      "\n",
      "     The following options are available:\n",
      "\n",
      "     -A      Adjust the access and modification time stamps for the file by\n",
      "             the specified value.  This flag is intended for use in modifying\n",
      "             files with incorrectly set time stamps.\n",
      "\n",
      "             The argument is of the form ``[-][[hh]mm]SS'' where each pair of\n",
      "             letters represents the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "                   -       Make the adjustment negative: the new time stamp is\n",
      "                           set to be before the old one.\n",

      "             The -A flag implies the -c flag: if any file specified does not\n",
