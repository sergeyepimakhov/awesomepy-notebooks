      "DESCRIPTION\n",
      "     The locate program searches a database for all pathnames which match the\n",

      "\n",
      "     Shell globbing and quoting characters (``*'', ``?'', ``\\'', ``['' and\n",

      "\n",
      "     As a special case, a pattern containing no globbing characters (``foo'')\n",
